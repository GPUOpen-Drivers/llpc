  let description = [{
    Generic (graphics) shader I/O interfaces are addressed in terms of locations. Locations are 4-element vectors with
    32-bit elements. Within an interface, the location vectors are indexed by `location + locOffset`. The elements of
    the vector are indexed by `elemIdx`.

    For some shader stages, the interface is inherently an array. For example, GS inputs are an array of per-vertex
    inputs, where the size of the array depends on the input primitive type (1 for points, 2 for lines, etc.).

    Some shader stages have both array and non-array interfaces. Specifically, TCS outputs and TES inputs have per-patch
    locations (non-array) and per-control-point locations (array with one entry per control point).

    For array interfaces, `arrayIndex` is used to index into the array, e.g. arrayIndex is the control point index (in
    TCS outputs and TES inputs) or the vertex index (in GS inputs). For non-array interfaces, `arrayIndex` is ignored
    entirely and is recommended to be set to `poison`.

    Some shader stages have a notion of inputs or outputs that are "per primitive":
    - TCS outputs: per-patch vs. per-control-point
    - TES inputs: per-patch vs. per-control-point
    - MESH outputs: per-primitive vs. per-vertex
    - PS inputs: per-primitive vs. per-vertex/interpolated (note: old-school flat-interpolated inputs are considered
      to be interpolated)
